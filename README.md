Music Meteorologist is a fullstack web application that has been built during the Labs15 (1st August 2019 - 30 September 2019) by
[LambdaSchool](https://lambdaschool.com/) students. Each student fulfills a role in the project to collectively build the application. (Roles listed below)

Music Meteorologist provides a web application where users can play a guessing game and get to know themself better. A sophisticated Machine Learning model will try to predict better than the user itself if a certain music song will be liked or not. For that a lot of different characteristics of a songs are considered. At the end the user can revisit the assessment of the model and give feedback about its correctness. To deliver this experience a Node.JS Backend and a React.JS Frontend were built.
