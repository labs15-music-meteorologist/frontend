Sound Drip is a fullstack web application that has been a Green Build during the Labs20 (13th January 2020 - 6th March 2020) by
[LambdaSchool](https://lambdaschool.com/) students. Each student fulfills a role in the project to collectively build the application. (Roles listed below)

Sound Drip provides music lovers with unique song recommendations based on Data Science functionality. Where A sophisticated Machine Learning model will try an predict songs you like better than the user could themselves; once a certain song is liked or not new songs will be populated for the user to listen and create a new playlist. For that to happen a lot of different characteristics of a songs are considered. 
<!-- At the end the user can revisit the assessment of the model and give feedback about its correctness. To deliver this experience a Node.JS Backend and a React.JS Frontend were built. -->
